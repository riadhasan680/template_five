# Affiliate Policy

PC Gamer is reader-supported. When you buy through links on our site, we may earn an affiliate commission.

## How it works

We pick products based on what we think is best for you. If you buy something through our links, we get a small cut of the sale. This helps fund our journalism and keeps our reviews independent.

## Our Promise

We will never recommend a product just because it has an affiliate link. We only recommend products we truly believe in.
