# Community Guidelines

We want PC Gamer to be a place where everyone can enjoy discussing PC games. To that end, we have a few simple rules:

1.  **Be respectful.** Treat others as you would like to be treated.
2.  **No hate speech.** Racism, sexism, homophobia, and other forms of hate speech will not be tolerated.
3.  **No spam.** Do not post the same message repeatedly or post links to unrelated sites.
4.  **Stay on topic.** Keep comments relevant to the article or discussion at hand.

Violating these guidelines may result in a ban.
