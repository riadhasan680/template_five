## What is Fisch?

Fisch is a Roblox experience that takes the relaxing pastime of fishing and turns it into a competitive and collection-focused adventure. Players can travel to various islands, upgrade their gear, and fill their aquarium with exotic species.

The game features a dynamic weather system, seasonal events, and a trading economy that keeps players coming back for more.

### Tips for Beginners

*   **Upgrade your inventory**: You can't catch big fish if your inventory is full. Prioritize bag upgrades early.
*   **Check the weather**: Some fish only appear during rain or storms.
*   **Group up**: Fishing with friends can provide passive bonuses.

Stay tuned for more updates and codes as the developers release them!
